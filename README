Homework Assignment 2
Rendering a 3D scene

Compile with the Makefile using the 'make clean'
and 'make' commands.

User Input:
	Escape key - close the program
	'0' - reset view angle
	'm' - switch projection mode
	'+' - zoom in
	'-' - zoom out
	viewpoint navigation - arrow keys

Additional Information:
	Rendering the Scene works, but there is some 
	lagging when changing the view angle.
	Implementing Face Culling could fix this.  Another
	option could be to decrease the number of
	cylinders which form the base for each piece.  
	Sacrifice smoothness in curvature of pieces
	for swift rendering.
